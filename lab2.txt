Lab 2

In Lab 1 we saw some ways of starting to configure the output of JSON-B format,
but we can customize the behaviour even more adjusting the objects being mapped, using JSON-B annotations.

Try it out Lab 2, make sure you only use JSON-B annotations! 
This link may come in handy to grasp the idea: https://json-b.net/docs/user-guide.html#changing-property-names 
Modify the Person class to answer the questions.

## Exercise

Suppose consumers of the JSON representation of Person would like the JSON to be
in their own language (other than English).

Try using @JsonbProperty annotations in the Person class from Lab1 to make the
JSON change the values of the fields. 

## Exercise

If the language uses custom date formatting, can you make sure the date of birth
is formatted appropriately according to the nationale?

## Exercise

Can you make sure the date of birth is always included in the output, even as
null value, avoiding any other null values to be printed?

## Exercise

In Dutch the order of the serialized properties is last name ("achternaam"),
date of birth ("geboortedatum"), first name ("voornaam").

Technically it does not matter, but suppose you'd like the name fields together,
instead of separated by the birth date.

Can you change the order of the fields in the output using @JsonbPropertyOrder?

## Exercise

The parameterless constructor added to the Person class to help deserialization
does not look nice. Let's remove it and see what happens if we try (example in
Dutch, as that was used in earlier customization, you can use your own):

Person p = jsonb.fromJson("{\"voornaam\":\"John\",\"achternaam\":\"Doe\",\"geboortedatum\":\"01-01-1900\"}", Person.class);

Create your own constructor with the addition of @JsonbCreator to be able to deserialize the JSON text to a Person object.
