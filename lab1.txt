Lab 1

# Set up a working environment

See readme.txt for some information on where to find JSON-B related libraries
and documentation.

Make sure you can write and execute Java code referencing the JSON-B and JSON-P
APIs and reference implementations.


# Serializing objects

Create a Jsonb object using JsonbBuilder and serialize an object. You can use the provided code in the lab1 package.


## Exercise

Serialize some basic objects like strings, numbers, booleans, date/times, and
look at the text output.


## Exercise

Serialize custom objects. Look at the Person class, and see how the sample data
gets serialized.

Make some changes to the code and see what effect they have on the serialized
text. (Add fields, change access modifiers, add or remove accessor methods, ...)


### Questions
What happens when fields are non-public? 
What happens when fields have a null value? 
In what order are the fields serialized? 


# Basic serialization configuration

Use the JsonbConfig class to configure the way Jsonb handles your objects.

JsonbConfig config = new JsonbConfig();
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create(config);

As exercise, try out the following configurations, and lookup further options in
the spec documentation or libraries.

## Pretty-print

To create fancy output (e.g. for a demo), you can use formatting. Try it!
config.withFormatting(true);

## Property naming strategy

By default JSON object keys are identical to the Java property names.
A different property naming strategy can be configured using the line below.

config.withPropertyNamingStrategy(PropertyNamingStrategy.LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES);

## Localized date format

Formatting the date can be done using DateFormat.

config.withDateFormat("EEEE dd MMMM yyyy", new Locale("nl", "NL"));


# Deserializing objects

Person p = jsonb.fromJson("{\"firstName\":\"Charles\",\"lastName\":\"Babbage\"}", Person.class);

Take a look at the "fromJson" line above.
Note that it is important that the field can be set for deserialization. Public getter and private or no setter may lead to unintended results, for instance.
You can try this by setting the firstName field in the Person class to private.


## Exercise

Try and deserialize some more JSON strings.
What happens if the JSON text contains key names that are not present as
property in the Java target class?
